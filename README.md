# **Simulation of humanoid walking**

**Class Group:** DT228 / TU856

## Description of the project: 
Form a humanoid using cubes and circles, 
then making it to walk like a normal human would,
maybe use inverse kinematics.

## Instructions for use:
the user only needs to press WASD (possibly QE) to move the humanoid

## How it works:
when the user press w, the humanoid will swing one of their hands forward 
along with their leg on the different side simulating a person's movement, 
when the user press A or D (QE included), the humanoid will strafe left/right, 
Q or E to turn right or left, then D to move backwards slowly.

## List of classes/assets in the project and whether made yourself or modified or if its from a source, please give the reference
Humanoid.cs - self written\
Movement.cs - written using inverse kinematics (current plan - using youtube videos and unity docs)
